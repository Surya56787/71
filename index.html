        The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be
        better organized and more efficient than they have been in the past.
        Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions
        of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional
        choices. Each student and staff member who accesses the canteen could be
        provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track
        of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have.
        Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all
        the fuss of money handling. making it safer and less complicated for staff and 
        students alike. More again, diversity is the key.

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy
        Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting
        computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records
        and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry.
        This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
        <br>
        2. Economics
        Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? it saves
        money by putting an end to innacurate time reporting. buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness,
        time alone, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Aesium Group found that large
        organizations save up to a $1,000 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
        <br>
        3. Productivity / Efficiency
        Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes
        time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leaveand overtime, and create
        payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you,
        from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time
        and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased
        productivity and improves profits. And many more like Visibiliy / Insights, Hassle free workflow Management,
